**SEVERITY**: CRITICAL  
**STATUS**: REMEDIATION IN PROGRESS  
**DATE**: August 16, 2025  

## Incident Summary

**CRITICAL SECURITY EXPOSURE**: Production VPS credentials and server endpoints were accidentally hardcoded and committed to a public GitHub repository.

### Exposed Information

- **VPS Server IP**: `185.163.117.155:8080`
- **API Key**: `cf89c3896dd1f14728b81c7be45e7d30d48e75517deb6e3c22335ff0a1635484`
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/syntax-sabotage/vps-memory-mcp-server`
- **Public Since**: August 16, 2025 ~14:32 UTC
- **Discovery**: August 16, 2025 ~15:00 UTC (approximately 28 minutes exposure)

## Impact Assessment

### IMMEDIATE RISKS
- âœ… **Unauthorized API Access**: Exposed API key allows full access to memory system
- âœ… **Data Exposure**: 790+ memories potentially accessible to unauthorized users
- âœ… **Service Disruption**: Potential for malicious API usage or DoS attacks
- âœ… **Credential Harvesting**: API key visible in git history and public searches

### AFFECTED SYSTEMS
- VPS Memory Server (`185.163.117.155:8080`)
- Memory Database (790+ entries)
- MCP Server Integration
- API Authentication System

## Remediation Actions Taken

### Phase 1: Immediate Security Response (IN PROGRESS)

#### 1.1 Credential Revocation (URGENT - PENDING)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Revoke exposed API key `cf89c3896dd1f14728b81c7be45e7d30d48e75517deb6e3c22335ff0a1635484`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Generate new secure API key for production
- [ ] Monitor VPS access logs for unauthorized attempts
- [ ] Implement IP whitelisting if possible

#### 1.2 Repository Security (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] **URGENT**: Make current repository private immediately
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Remove hardcoded credentials from codebase
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Replace with environment variable configuration
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Add comprehensive .gitignore for sensitive files
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Update security documentation

#### 1.3 Code Sanitization (COMPLETED)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Remove all hardcoded server endpoints and credentials
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement mandatory environment variable validation
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Add security-first error handling
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Create secure configuration template (.env.example)

### Phase 2: Public Template Creation (IN PROGRESS)

#### 2.1 Security-Cleaned Repository
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Create security-first codebase with zero credentials
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Environment-based configuration system
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive security documentation
- [ ] **PENDING**: Create new public repository as template
- [ ] **PENDING**: Configure GitHub security features

#### 2.2 Template Features
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Zero hardcoded credentials or endpoints
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Mandatory environment variable validation
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Security-first README with configuration guide
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive .env.example template
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Enhanced SECURITY.md with incident disclosure

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event | Action |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 14:32 | Repository created publicly | Credentials exposed |
| 14:33 | Initial commit with credentials | Public exposure begins |
| 15:00 | Security incident discovered | Emergency response initiated |
| 15:05 | Credential audit completed | Full scope identified |
| 15:15 | Code sanitization started | Hardcoded credentials removed |
| 15:30 | Security documentation updated | Template preparation |
| 15:45 | Template codebase completed | Ready for new repository |

## Remaining Actions (CRITICAL)

### IMMEDIATE (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Revoke exposed API key on VPS server**
2. **Make current repository private**
3. **Generate new production API key**
4. **Monitor access logs for unauthorized usage**

### SHORT TERM (Next 2 hours)
1. **Create new public template repository**
2. **Configure GitHub security scanning**
3. **Notify stakeholders of incident**
4. **Document lessons learned**

### MEDIUM TERM (Next 24 hours)
1. **Implement enhanced security monitoring**
2. **Review all other repositories for similar issues**
3. **Update development processes to prevent recurrence**
4. **Conduct security audit of VPS server**

## Lessons Learned

### ROOT CAUSE
- Hardcoded production credentials in development code
- Lack of pre-commit hooks for credential detection
- Missing security review process for public repositories

### PREVENTION MEASURES
1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Implement credential detection before commits
2. **Security Review**: Mandatory review process for public repositories
3. **Environment Segregation**: Clear separation of dev/prod credentials
4. **Training**: Team training on secure coding practices
5. **Automated Scanning**: Regular credential scanning of all repositories
