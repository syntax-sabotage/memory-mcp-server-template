   - **Tier 3**: Human escalation with notification channels and impact assessment
   - Comprehensive conflict tracking and resolution history

3. **Global Pattern Learning Framework**
   - Machine learning-based pattern recognition
   - Pattern types: workflow, resolution, optimization, prediction
   - Adaptive pattern application with confidence scoring
   - Pattern usage tracking and success rate optimization

4. **Enhanced API Endpoints for Professional Workflows**
