# Security Policy

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE**: This repository template contains NO hardcoded credentials or server endpoints. All sensitive configuration MUST be provided via environment variables.

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of Memory MCP Server Template with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Fully Supported |
| 0.x.x   | ❌ No longer supported |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Key Management**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Rotate API keys regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
   - Use different API keys for different environments

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all VPS memory server connections
   - Implement firewall rules to restrict access to VPS endpoints
   - Consider VPN or private networks for production deployments

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit API key permissions to minimum required scope
   - Monitor API usage for unusual patterns
   - Implement rate limiting where possible

4. **Environment Security**
   - Keep Node.js and npm dependencies up to date
   - Run security audits regularly (`npm audit`)
   - Use container scanning for Docker deployments

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Input validation using Zod schemas
   - Sanitization of user-provided content
   - Proper error handling without information leakage
   - Regular dependency updates

2. **Authentication**
   - Secure storage of credentials
   - Proper session management
   - Timeout handling for connections
